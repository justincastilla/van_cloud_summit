# Introduction to OpenTelemetry with Python
OpenTelemetry (OTel) is a vendor-neutral, open-source framework for observability designed to be compatible with any backend system. It offers standardized APIs, libraries, and tools for gathering telemetry data, including metrics, logs, and traces. This presentation serves as an introduction to using OpenTelemetry with Python. This repository is a fork from [this](https://github.com/JessicaGarson/Introduction-to-OpenTelemetry-with-Python) repository by @JessicaGarson.
